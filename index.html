        <h3>Professional Statement</h3>
        <p>I am a multidisciplinary creator blending software engineering, game design, and music to craft emotionally resonant experiences. With a focus on thoughtful storytelling and immersive interactivity, I build systems that engage both intellect and the senses. My work is driven by a desire to explore complexity through nuance and clarity — creating spaces that invite reflection, curiosity, and emotional depth.</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I’m a software engineer and creative technologist with a background in music composition, narrative design, and immersive media. I approach every project with a systems-thinking mindset — balancing structure and logic with emotion and meaning. My goal is to build experiences that not only function well but feel purposeful.</p>
        <p>My creative work is often introspective, drawing from a deep curiosity about the human condition, ethics, and emotional expression. Whether I’m coding complex systems in Unity, scoring music to convey a psychological state, or designing narrative flow through interactivity, I’m always seeking to create something that resonates.</p>
        <p>I value minimalism, clarity, and intentional design. I believe the best work often happens quietly, behind the scenes, through disciplined iteration and reflection. I’m not interested in noise for the sake of visibility — I care about impact, integrity, and crafting work that speaks for itself.</p>

        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
        <p>I create things because I enjoy it. There’s a sense of calm that comes from building something from the ground up — whether it’s a piece of music, a system, or an experience that leaves an impression.</p>
        <p>I’m not chasing trends or trying to impress anyone. I just like making things that work, that feel good to use, and that reflect a bit of who I am. If someone connects with it, that’s a bonus — but the process itself is what matters to me.</p>
        <p>Creativity isn’t about constant noise or validation. It’s about tuning into what feels real, and following that instinct until it turns into something worth sharing.</p>
