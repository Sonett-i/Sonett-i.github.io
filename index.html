        <h3>Professional Statement</h3>
        <p>I'm a game developer and musician driven by curiosity, quiet determination, and a love of complex, meaningful systems. With a background in both software and sound, I bring a thoughtful approach to everything I build — whether it's a narrative-driven game, a haunting score, or a small mechanic that just feels right.</p>
        <p>I don’t rush things. I enjoy solving hard problems, exploring edge cases, and pushing past the surface level to find what really works. My path hasn’t always been easy, but it’s given me a quiet resilience that shows in my work. I value clarity, craft, and projects that leave room for reflection.</p>
        <p>When I’m not coding or composing, I’m usually listening, observing, or walking — giving ideas the space they need to grow. I’m not the loudest person in the room, but I often pick up on what others miss.</p>
        <p>If you're looking for someone who thrives in focused, creative environments and brings both technical depth and emotional intuition to the table, I’m always open to meaningful collaborations.</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hey, I’m Sam — a game developer and composer based in Australia. I’m drawn to systems that make you think, worlds that feel slightly off-kilter, and music that lingers long after it ends.</p>
        <p>My work is often introspective, rooted in a curiosity about the human condition, ethics, and emotional expression. Whether I’m building complex mechanics in Unity, scoring music to reflect a psychological state, or shaping narrative through interactivity, I aim to create experiences that resonate.</p>
        <p>I value minimalism, clarity, and intentional design. The best work often happens quietly — through disciplined iteration, reflection, and a focus on what truly matters. I’m not here to chase noise; I care about impact, integrity, and letting the work speak for itself.</p>

        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
        <p>I create because I enjoy it. There’s a calm in building something from the ground up — whether it’s a piece of music, a system, or an experience that leaves an impression.</p>
        <p>I’m not chasing trends or trying to impress anyone. I just like making things that work, feel good to use, and carry a piece of who I am. If someone connects with it, that’s a bonus — but for me, it’s about the process.</p>
        <p>Creativity isn’t about noise or validation. It’s about tuning into what feels real and following that instinct until it becomes something worth sharing.</p>
